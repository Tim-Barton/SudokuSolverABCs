# SudokuSolverABCs
Solving Sudoku puzzles using a language from every letter of the English Alphabet

## Why?

For something to do, and as a way to expose myself to as many different languages as possible

Going to be starting with [this list from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages), throwing in some [Tiobe index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) considerations, plus some of my own personal "I wonder what that's like" moments

## Rules

1. I can't have used the language before
2. Preferably I can Dockerise the build/run environment

## What does this exclude

* Go - prior use
* C\C++ - prior use
* Java - prior use
* Javascript - prior use (this is a technicality, but one I'm sticking to)
* Python - prior use ([I've done this exercise before in it](https://github.com/Tim-Barton/SudokuSolver))
* Bash/Zsh/etc - prior use
* Scala - prior use
* C# - prior use ([I've done this exercise before in it](https://github.com/Tim-Barton/SudokuSolverCSharp))
